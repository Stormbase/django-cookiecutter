## Linting

This project uses a few tools to ensure quality code.

- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black/) The uncompromising Python code formatter.
- [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) A Python utility / library to sort imports.

You can call these tools by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
./script/lint
```

### Fixing linting errors

Some linting errors can be automatically resolved by reformatting the code.

Try running the formatting script:
```sh
./script/format
```
